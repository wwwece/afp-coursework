> This coursework is inspired by the [bAbI project](https://research.fb.com/projects/babi/) of Facebook AI Research which aims to improve automatic text understanding and reasoning and evaluate
it through question answering.

Basic idea is to give answers based on some story. 
See [description/questions.txt](https://github.com/WeceW/afp-coursework/blob/master/description/questions.txt) (question and answer types) & 
[input-files/test.txt](https://github.com/WeceW/afp-coursework/blob/master/input-files/test.txt) (example story)
to get the idea.
